# 🤖 TicTacTAI – React + DeepSeek AI Tic Tac Toe

TicTacTAI is the **world's first** open-source Tic Tac Toe game built using **React** and powered by **DeepSeek AI** through the **OpenRouter API**.

This project demonstrates how to use real LLMs like DeepSeek to build a smart AI opponent, and teaches fallback logic if the AI fails — making it a perfect project for students learning AI + React integration.
